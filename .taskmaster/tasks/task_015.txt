# Task ID: 15
# Title: Comprehensive Integration Testing and Amnesia Test
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Run full verification suite including Amnesia Test and Crash Test
# Details:
Execute all manual tests 1.1-3.3. Amnesia Test: Work on repo1 30min, switch away 24h, pd switch repo1, commit code <5min. Crash Test: kill terminal, pd switch, verify exact state restored.

# Test Strategy:
Pass all 6 Green Lights + Amnesia/Crash tests. Tune scribe prompt if SITREP insufficient.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Prepare Environment for Integration Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the testing environment to ensure all dependencies and configurations are ready for the integration tests.
### Details:
Ensure that all necessary services are running and accessible. Verify that the latest code is checked out and all dependencies are installed. Confirm that the testing environment mirrors the production environment as closely as possible.

## 2. Execute Manual Tests 1.1-3.3 [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Run the specified manual tests to verify basic functionality before proceeding with Amnesia and Crash tests.
### Details:
Follow the manual test scripts for tests 1.1 through 3.3. Document any deviations or unexpected results. Ensure that each test passes as expected before moving on.

## 3. Conduct Amnesia Test [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2
### Description: Perform the Amnesia Test to verify system behavior after a period of inactivity.
### Details:
Work on repo1 for 30 minutes, then switch away for 24 hours. After 24 hours, switch back to repo1 and commit code within 5 minutes. Document the state of the system before and after the inactivity period.

## 4. Conduct Crash Test [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.3
### Description: Perform the Crash Test to verify system recovery after an unexpected shutdown.
### Details:
Simulate a crash by killing the terminal session. Use 'pd switch' to restore the session and verify that the exact state is restored. Document the steps taken and the state of the system before and after the crash.

## 5. Document Test Results and Observations [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.4
### Description: Compile a detailed report of the test results, including any issues encountered and their resolutions.
### Details:
Create a comprehensive document that includes the results of all tests conducted, any anomalies observed, and steps taken to resolve issues. Include screenshots or logs as necessary to support findings.

## 6. Review and Finalize Test Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.5
### Description: Conduct a peer review of the test documentation to ensure accuracy and completeness.
### Details:
Have a team member review the test documentation for clarity, accuracy, and completeness. Address any feedback or corrections needed.
