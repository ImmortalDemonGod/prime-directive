# Task ID: 32
# Title: Enhance pd status with Last Touched Timestamp
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add filesystem scanning logic to pd status to find the most recent file modification time for each repository, respecting .gitignore, and add a Last Touched column to the status table.
# Details:
1. Modify the pd status command to include a new column 'Last Touched' which displays the most recent file modification time (mtime) for each repository.
2. Implement a filesystem scanning function that traverses the repository directories, respecting .gitignore files, to determine the latest mtime.
3. Use Python's os and pathlib modules to efficiently scan directories and retrieve file mtimes.
4. Integrate this logic into the existing status command, ensuring that the Last Touched column is updated dynamically based on the latest file activity.
5. Update the status table rendering logic to include the new column, ensuring it is displayed clearly alongside existing columns.

# Test Strategy:
1. Create a test repository with multiple files and a .gitignore file.
2. Modify some files and run the pd status command to verify that the Last Touched column reflects the most recent file modification times.
3. Ensure that files listed in .gitignore are not considered in the Last Touched calculation.
4. Test with various repository structures and file types to ensure robustness.
5. Verify that the status table displays the Last Touched column correctly and that it updates as expected when files are modified.
