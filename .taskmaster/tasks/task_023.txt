# Task ID: 23
# Title: Tier 2: AI provider manager with OpenAI fallback + cost/consent guardrails
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 22
# Priority: high
# Description: Introduce AI provider abstraction (Ollama primary, OpenAI fallback) with explicit user consent and budget controls.
# Details:
Create core/ai_providers.py defining provider interfaces for Ollama and OpenAI. Add Hydra config fields for primary/fallback providers/models, monthly budget, and require-confirmation flag. Implement selection logic: try Ollama first; if unavailable, fall back to OpenAI only if configured and within budget/consent settings. Ensure provider choice is clearly logged.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests simulating: Ollama up, Ollama down with OpenAI key set, Ollama down without OpenAI key, and budget/consent blocking fallback. Verify freeze still produces a SITREP or a clear placeholder without crashing.
