# Task ID: 25
# Title: Tier 3 (Optional): Auto-install Python-only dependencies (allowlist, venv-only)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 23
# Priority: low
# Description: Optionally auto-install missing Python packages (e.g., openai, tenacity) inside the active venv using a strict allowlist; never install system binaries.
# Details:
Implement core/auto_installer.py that checks for allowlisted packages and installs them with pip inside the current interpreter environment. Add Hydra config flag auto_install_python_deps and keep auto_install_system_deps forced false. Integrate into OpenAI provider initialization if enabled.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests that mock subprocess/pip calls and verify allowlist enforcement. Ensure feature is off by default and does not run in CI unless explicitly enabled.
