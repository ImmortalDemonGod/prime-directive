# Task ID: 30
# Title: Implement Interactive Freeze Protocol
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor the pd freeze command to initiate an interactive interview process instead of using a single --note flag.
# Details:
Refactor the existing pd freeze command to default to an interactive multi-question interview. This interview will replace the current --note flag and will consist of the following questions: 1) What is the primary objective of this session? 2) What didn't work or what is the key uncertainty? 3) What is the next concrete action? 4) Optional: Any additional notes or brain dump. Update the ContextSnapshot schema in core/db.py to include new structured fields: human_objective, human_blocker, human_next_step. Ensure that the responses to these questions are stored in the database in a structured format to improve the quality of AI-generated SITREPs. Consider user experience and ensure the interview is user-friendly and intuitive.

# Test Strategy:
1. Run the pd freeze command and verify that the interactive interview is initiated.
2. Answer each question in the interview and complete the process.
3. Check the database to ensure that the responses are stored correctly in the new structured fields: human_objective, human_blocker, human_next_step.
4. Verify that the AI-generated SITREP uses the new structured data fields to produce a coherent summary.
5. Conduct user testing to ensure the interview process is intuitive and user-friendly.
