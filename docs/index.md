# Prime Directive Documentation

**Prime Directive** is an AI-powered context preservation system for developers working across multiple repositories.

## Overview

When you're deep in a coding session and need to switch to another project, Prime Directive captures your current context—git state, terminal history, active tasks, and generates an AI summary—so you can seamlessly return later without losing your train of thought.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
uv pip install -e .

# Check system status
pd doctor

# Freeze context before switching
pd freeze my-project

# Switch to another project
pd switch other-project
```

## Core Concepts

### Context Snapshots

A context snapshot captures:
- **Git State** — Branch, uncommitted files, recent commits
- **Terminal State** — Last command and output summary
- **Active Task** — Current task from Task Master
- **AI SITREP** — Situational report generated by Ollama/OpenAI

### Repository Tracking

Repositories are tracked via `prime_directive/system/registry.yaml`:

```yaml
repos:
  my-project:
    path: /path/to/my-project
  other-project:
    path: /path/to/other-project
```

### Tmux Integration

Each repository gets its own tmux session (`pd-{repo_id}`), ensuring isolated terminal environments.

## CLI Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pd doctor` | Check system dependencies |
| `pd list` | List tracked repositories |
| `pd status <repo>` | Show repository status |
| `pd freeze <repo>` | Save current context |
| `pd switch <repo>` | Switch to repository |

## Configuration

See `prime_directive/conf/config.yaml` for all configuration options.
